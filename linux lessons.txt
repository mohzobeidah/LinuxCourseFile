--
root userid = 0
after that userid = 1000
0< userid <1000 system users or serivce user 

----------------
give dummy user for serices 
 for run the serivce
------
the file that save all users will exist in \etc\passwd
there is all alot of users 
**********************
FSH File system Hierarchy 

home-->
main partition is called /  -- root only one
inside it there are folders like home etc dev tmp var 
the folder that contain users is called home 
instead of users in windows 


etc --> Direcoty to save all device configrations
and every serivce has its  Configration file or folder 

dev --> 
rule 1 : everything is a file in linux like mouse parttion harddisk
Kernel Access to Hardware By dev folder 

tmp --> temp file  for streaming video 
as  example 
after reboot is over 
clean up serivce is pass over tmp to clean up it

special usr --> user 

for shared files between all users 

backgrouns for all users 
 theme of linux are shared files 


bin--> binaries folder for save all command like pwd and ls and su that translate to bianary

sbin--> super binaries folder for 
binaries folder for save all command like pwd and ls and su that translate to bianary
for only Super user 
administrative command

var --> variable files  important
 every logout or login  save in log file
files that change periodically 
 like mails and mysql 

root -->
home direcoty for root is in the root folder 
isolate the root with its files 

we can give permssion for all users
 
proc-->  information for hardware and software 
get all informations for the machine the kernal must know 
ervery thing in this machine insdie folder Cpuinfo
Kernal deal with service will be save in proc 
when you reboot will be deleted 
sys--> same as proc but for hardware

opt --> folder emtpy that wil be vendros 
like to have separated folder like Oracle

srv --> for server 

3 roots 
1-root user
2-root folder 
3- / root file system like c virtual point for files

*************commands*************************
 
ls  / 




srv -->folder emtpy that will install serivce in future 

media  --> for Assign usb or removable devices CDs
 device you can acces it in this fodler 
 (mounting Process) 
mnt--> In days of floppy disk 

boot --> folder for kernal and bootloader that can boot kernel 

*************command****************

ls /home/moh  

you can put / in end of folder not file 

words with White color is file 
words with Bule color is diecortory
words with green color is execuatable file

rules 2 in linux file name is  Case sernsitve 

absolute Path : full path
relative Path : 
. Current working directory
.. Parent  working directory

****************************
cat -- concatenate command --> to browse  content of txt file 
ls -- list  command list file inside directory 
pwd  __command persent working directory -- command  show your location as directory 
dir  __comand -- same as ls without coloring
cd -  __ command  to return to perivous directory you was working it before
cd /   _command chage diectory command for move between files and folders 
cd    _command go to home  Diectory  for yours 
cd ~  _command go to home Diectory for yours cd ~ = cd but 
you can goes to home of another user like cd ~moh whivch 
will goes to home Diectory of moh
touch <namefile>  __command to create empty txt file 
tree __command to list file in tree shape 
mkdir __command make directory 
cp __command copy  file 
cp -r __command copy Directory recursive  will overwrite if exist 
mv __command move the file or directory 
rm __command remove file 
rmdir __command remove directory 
rm -rf __command remove directory inside files 
ls -a __ command  show all files include hidden in linux start with . dot
ls -r __command show files arranged reverse alphaptical order 
ls -R __command show files recersive 
file <nameof file> __command give you the signature of file metadata
logout 
exit
clear ctrl + l
reboot 
shudown -r now
systemctl reboot
shutdown -r now 
shudtown  now 
poweroff 
poweroff -r 
less __command for paginate files content q to quit 
more __command same less but it quit when finish 


****************

shape of command 
command  [option] [arguments]
[]--> optional choice 
rm [-r] [file1,file2] 


****************
shorcut Important 
ctrl + a  to move cursor in the begining of line 
ctrl + e  to move cursor in the end of line
ctrl + k  to move cursor in the cut of line to end of line
ctrl + u  to move cursor in the cut of line to begining of line
ctrl + d to logout 
ctrl + s to lock on scressn 
ctrl + q unlock for scressn 
**********************
EXECUTE TWO COMMAND in smae line 
ls;date
***********************************************************
Users and groups 
 userid for root =0
bydefault when you create user 
automatially group with same name are created
user can has many group 
but user has only one primary group it only for this user

useradd <name> __commmand to create user
id <username>
uid=1001 gid=1001(moh) groups=1001(moh)
uid userid 
gid main group groupid 
groups = other groups for user
---------
g== for primary group 
G== for secondary Group 

add primary
groupadd <nameofGroup>  for adding gruops 

add group primary for new user 
useradd -g <nameofPrimaryGroup> <nameOfUser>

add group secondary for user 
usermod -G <nameofSecondaryGroup> <nameOfUser>

-G romove any secondary group and add new  secondary group 
to avoid this add -a 

usermod -a -G <nameofSecondaryGroup> <nameOfUser>

usermod -g <nameofPrimaryGroup> <nameOfUser>
-----------------------------------------------------
file /etc/user what is contain ?
user1:x:1001:1001::/home/user1:/bin/bash
username :password hashed:userid : primary id :description: home directory path: shell diectory path
/etc/passwd  password 
/etc/shadow

file /etc/group  what is contain ?
dbagroup:x:1006::user1
groupname:groupPassword hashed : group admin:list of user as memeber 
/etc/passwd  password 
/etc/shadow
! in linux means not set password

remove user with his primay group  but its file exist 
userdel <nameofUser> 
 in this case use command 
rm -rf /home/user1 
userdel -r user1

remove primay group for more than users it will not be deleted 
but secondary group for more than users it will be deleted without any problem
primary Group is very important !!

groupdel <nameOfGroup>

when you create user without  password  the user will not login
user active has right to make operation on system 
user deactive has not right to make operation on system 

******************************************************

-R  for apply permission on files and folder inside the folder 

to change the owner of file
chown <username> <filename>  

to change the grpup of file
chown  -R :<groupName> <filename>
chown  -R  :dbagroup file1 

to change the owner and grpup of file both
chown  -R  <owner>:<groupName> <filename>

to give permssion as number 
777 for full permission 

chown -R 765  <filename>  
chown -R 000  <filename> remove all premissions

*******************Redirection****************************
after exection command the result will be saved in file 
like 
ls 1>result take result into result file 
ls 2>result take result of error into result file 
ls 1> result 2>error

-- in above it  make override on the file but the solution use
>> instead of one 

ls 1>>result.txt take result into result file 
ls 2>>result.txt take result of error into result file 
ls 1>> result.txt 2>>error.txt

ls 2&>> result .txt put the reusult and error in same file

we use 
cat <<EOT>> result.txt  EOT this can be change in your choice 
cat <file.txt> result.txt copy the content of file.txt to result.txt
cat <<file.txt>> result.txt append the content of file.txt to result.txt


************pipe | **************
take the output of one command to be input for another command

ls -Rl / | less 
ls |tee -a result.txt
tee make override on the file 
tee -a make append on data exist in file before

MBR ==> master boot recod ==>> piece in font of disk it is necssary 512 byte
 this is map of disk partiation 
it consist of 3  
- partition table spify the beging of patition and its end 64 byte 
every partition must know the file system that inside it 
every partition has 14 byte 
- file system : orginse the store and retrive data like Fat ntfs ext2 and ext3 and xfs and ext4 btrfs 
Fat32 file must not be bigger than 4 G not suppert like ecryption and compression 
ntfs file not be bigger than 250 T  
-inode table for evey partition  ==> blocks in patition 
block number that store file AND OWENER AND PREMSSION and metadata for this file 

format prepare the disk for new data
what is the diffences between file and directory ?
folder is spiecal file is pionting to anothe files 


entry of file ---> file inode number , premmision access time and type and owner and modification time and length count 
entry of directory ---> file inode number , premmision access time and  type and owner and modification time and length count and pointer of files which contian 

to know th inode int linux 
ls -li the __command show f  number wil appear is the inode number 
df __command disk free space 

give you the following
file system  | blocks |  used | avaible | use%  | mount on
df -h    __command disk free space for human readble 
df -i __command disk free space  and give a inode number

*****************************************************************************
soft link  shortcut refrence point two to refrence not inode 
hard link same inode refered by two refrence 



touch text1

two file will point two same i node when delte one the other will be still exist with same data
>> ls make soft link 
ln -s  file1 file2  __command 
when you use the soft link you must use absolute path
